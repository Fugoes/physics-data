** Why do we program?
   - Delegate repeatative tasks
   - Record what you did
** Python environment
   - Real GNU/Linux
     + Debian
     + Gentoo
   - Jupyter based
   - Windows based

   Windows based python installation has caveats, because python is
   developed under Unix.  Be prepared for unexpected bugs if you
   decide to use Python on windows.

** Choose an editor
   - Emacs
   - Vi
   - Others
     - atom.io
   Both emacs and vi have steep learning curves, they are not easy to
   learn.  But if you master any of them, they pays you.

   Don't use Microsoft Word or Windows Notepad, they are not for
   programs.  Because we need an editor that do plain text and
   syntactically correct.
** Playground

   Do we need one?  I don't think so.

** Jupyter
   - Causal way to completing classes.
** Installing Python
   + Windows
     - Not impossible.
     - No good package manager.
       - ... what is package manager?
       - pip on windows is a hack.
     - Snipping tool.
   + Macos
     - No good package manager.
       - Need extra care when using pip, easy to screw up.
   + GNU/Linux
     - steep learning curve.
     - not everything is obvious.
     - pays you back if you are committed to deal with data and
       programs: experimental physicist, data scientist, quant, etc.
       That is the main audience this course is targeting.
     - I am going to give lectures, examples, demonstrations on
       GNU/Linux with emacs.
   + You can try them if you are brave, and you are encouraged to find
     your own work style.
** Submit screen shots
   - Needed skill for online discussion.

** Write paragraphs of code
   - Basic programming structures
     - sequential

     - iterative
     - recursive
   - Early exit

   - A proof that all reasonable programs can be decoupled into
     combinations of the 3 constructs. ???

** Linux 系统安装
   - Virtualbox
     - 针对运维工作
       - 软件保守，不适合学术
       - 命令行为主，与科学计算很类似
     - 运行在 MacOS
   - 使用英语环境
     - 中文的高质量资料很少，中文的社区非常薄弱且小众
     - 英语是程序的天然语言，对科技表达更丰富
     - 世界目前的约定，各国科学家都在通过英语交流
   - 如果立志建设中文社区，请先通过英语学习成为高手
** 命令行界面
   - 与计算机交互的精髓
     - 比随意点选更有助于可复现性
